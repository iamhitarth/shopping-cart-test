# Shopping Cart Test

This project is a very basic shopping cart app that consists of a C# .Net Core API (that serves up the products and shipping costs) and a React frontend that allows users to add products to a basket, remove them and then place an order.

To start the API at `https://localhost:5001`, navigate to the Git repo directory and execute `cd HitarthShoppingCartAPI/HitarthShoppingCartAPI && dotnet run` .

Then, to start the frontend, from the Git repo directory, execute `cd app && yarn start` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to use it.
